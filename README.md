# Employee Database Manager

## Description

This project was created to manage a database of employees using onscreen prompts through node.js using inquirer. You'd choose from a list of prompts to choose what to do with your database. At this time, you won't be able to delete employees from the database. You'll be able to see the list of employees, add them to a department, give them a role, include salary, and determine who is a manger.

## Installation

You'll need Node.JS to use this project. You'll need open the integrated termine in the root of the project (so like the server.js file), then type "npm i". This will install all of the dependencies you'll need.
    

## Usage

Once you have followed the installation instructions, the following dependencies will be installed: console.table, dotenv, inquirer, jest, mysql12, and node. Console.table puts the data in a readable format, you'll put your username and password in a .env file so the database can run, inquirer is used to interact with the user, mysql2 will help you manage the database. Once the integrated terminal is open, you'll type "npm start" and all of the prompts will come up for you to interact with.
